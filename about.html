      <!-- <h2>Our Mission: Making Math Intuitive</h2> -->
      <p>
        Trivial Math is a personal project born from a passion for making mathematics clear, accessible, and—most importantly—intuitive. In a world awash with information, finding structured, high-quality learning resources can be a challenge. This website serves as a digital garden of curated notes and study materials designed to support students, professionals, and lifelong learners on their mathematical journey. Our goal is to bridge the gap between dense academic texts and genuine understanding.

      <h2>Meet the Creator</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm [Your Name], the creator and primary author behind Trivial Math.
         With a background in [Your Field, e.g., Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics], 
         I've spent years navigating both academic and practical applications of these subjects. 
         I created this site as a way to organize my own knowledge and share the learning methods that I've found most effective.
          My hope is that these resources can help you as much as they've helped me.
